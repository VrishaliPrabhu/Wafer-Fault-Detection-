# Wafer-Fault-Detection-
Wafer is a thin slice of Semiconductor Material which is used in various Electronic Devices.In any Production Line various Wafers are deployed and if any wafer is faulty then whole production line needs to stop and Manualy need to check the faulty wafer.The Project is about to detect which wafer is faulty and only that section of production line is closed.
To implement this a classification methodology is used to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data.
I would like to give this project credits to Team Ineuron.
